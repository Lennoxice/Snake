# Snake in multiplayer mode

This scratch project contains a not-yet-finished version of a multiplayer snake game.
The main implementation is done and the game is already working, but some styling can be reworked.

Some possible enhancements are:
- implementing a kind of "cool down" for snake movement (currently, you can move back by quickly pressing buttons)
- design of the winScreen (fix typo)
- set a proper grid for snake movement (consider snake head and tail sizes) to prevent hitting the edge unintentionally
- guide the user by inserting hints for pressable keys on each menu (e.g. controls)
- implement quit on mainScreen
